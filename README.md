This project explores employee burnout through the lens of linear regression. By examining a dataset with features related to work conditions, job satisfaction, and employee demographics, the goal is to identify key factors contributing to burnout and predict burnout levels using a regression model. The analysis is performed in Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for modeling, and Matplotlib for visualization. Users can clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and execute the analysis script to generate insights and predictions about employee burnout. The results include both numerical predictions and visualizations, providing a comprehensive view of the factors affecting burnout in the workplace.
